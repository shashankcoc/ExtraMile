Project Report: Employee Performance Review Feedback System
Overview
The Employee Performance Review Feedback System is a web application designed to facilitate the process of submitting feedback on each other's performance reviews among employees. The application consists of two main views: Admin View and Employee View. The Admin View allows administrators to manage employees, performance reviews, and assign employees to participate in another employee's performance review. The Employee View enables employees to view a list of performance reviews requiring feedback and submit their feedback.
Technologies Used
The application was developed using React for the frontend and Firebase as the backend. The choice of technologies was driven by the need for rapid development and ease of use. Additionally, pure CSS was used to reduce package size and maintain a lightweight approach.
Features Implemented
The following features have been implemented:
Admin View
• Add employees
• View employees
• Add performance reviews
• View performance reviews
• Assign employees to participate in another employee's performance review
Employee View
• List of performance reviews requiring feedback
• Submit Feedback (partial implementation, pending completion)
Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive and compatible with all devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across various platforms.
Scope of Improvement
While the application has made significant progress, there are areas that require further development and refinement. These include:
• Implementing edit functionality for employees and performance reviews
• Completing the feedback submission feature
• Enhancing the user interface and user experience
• Exploring opportunities for scalability and performance optimization
Hosting Challenges
Currently, the application is not hosted due to difficulties in configuring Vite with React. If I had more time, I would also focus on hosting the web application. For now, I am trying to resolve the hosting issues and will share the application as soon as it is successfully hosted.
